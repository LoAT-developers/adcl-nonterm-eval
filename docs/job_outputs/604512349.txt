	Eliminating location [3] by chaining:

	Applied chaining

	First rule:
	[2] -> [3] : x >= 0, cost: 1
	Second rule:
	[3] -> [4] : x'=10-2*x, T, cost: 1
	New rule:
	[2] -> [4] : x'=10-2*x, x >= 0, cost: 1
	
	Applied deletion

	Removed the following rules: 1 2
	
	Eliminating location [4] by chaining:

	Applied chaining

	First rule:
	[2] -> [4] : x'=10-2*x, x >= 0, cost: 1

	[4] -> [2] : T, cost: 1
	New rule:
	[2] -> [2] : x'=10-2*x, x >= 0, cost: 1
	
	Applied deletion

	Removed the following rules: 3 5
