	Eliminating location [3] by chaining:

	Applied chaining

	First rule:
	[2] -> [3] : y >= 0, cost: 1
	Second rule:
	[3] -> [4] : y'=-1+y, T, cost: 1
	New rule:
	[2] -> [4] : y'=-1+y, y >= 0, cost: 1
	
	Applied deletion

	Removed the following rules: 1 2

	Loop Acceleration

	Original rule:
	[2] -> [2] : y'=-1+y, (y >= 0), cost: 1
	New rule:
	[2] -> [2] : y'=-n+y, (-1+n >= 0 /\ 1-n+y >= 0), cost: 1

		y >= 0 [0]: montonic decrease yields 1-n+y >= 0
		
		y >= 0 [1]: eventual increase yields (1 <= 0 /\ y >= 0)
		
		Replacement map: {y >= 0 -> 1-n+y >= 0}
