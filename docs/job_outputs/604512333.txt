	Eliminating location [5] by chaining:

	Applied chaining

	First rule:
	[3] -> [5] : -6+x > 0, cost: 1
	Second rule:
	[5] -> [6] : x'=2+x, T, cost: 1
	New rule:
	[3] -> [6] : x'=2+x, -6+x > 0, cost: 1
	
	Applied deletion

	Removed the following rules: 2 3

		10-x >= 0 [0]: monotonic increase yields 10-x >= 0
		
		6-x >= 0 [0]: monotonic increase yields 6-x >= 0
		
		Replacement map: {10-x >= 0 -> 10-x >= 0, 6-x >= 0 -> 6-x >= 0}
