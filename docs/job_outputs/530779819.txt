Initially, performed program simplifications using lexicographic rank functions:
 * Removed transitions 145, 179, 181, 182 using the following rank functions:
    - Rank function 1:
      RF for loc. 77: -1-2*ip_0+2*n_0
      RF for loc. 125: -2*ip_0+2*n_0
      Bound for (chained) transitions 145, 179: -1
    - Rank function 2:
      RF for loc. 77: 0
      RF for loc. 125: 1
      Bound for (chained) transitions 181: 1
