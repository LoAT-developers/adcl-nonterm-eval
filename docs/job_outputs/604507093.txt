Initial ITS

Start location: l2
Program variables: x^0
   0: l0 -> l1 : x^0'=x^post1, -1+x^post1 == 0, cost: 1
   1: l2 -> l0 : x^0'=x^post2, -x^post2+x^0 == 0, cost: 1

Chained Linear Paths

Start location: l2
Program variables: x^0
   2: l2 -> l1 : x^0'=x^post1, (-1+x^post1 == 0 /\ -x^post2+x^0 == 0), cost: 1

	Eliminating location l0 by chaining:

	Applied chaining

	First rule:
	l2 -> l0 : x^0'=x^post2, -x^post2+x^0 == 0, cost: 1
	Second rule:
	l0 -> l1 : x^0'=x^post1, -1+x^post1 == 0, cost: 1
	New rule:
	l2 -> l1 : x^0'=x^post1, (-1+x^post1 == 0 /\ -x^post2+x^0 == 0), cost: 1
	
	Applied deletion

	Removed the following rules: 0 1

Simplified Transitions

Start location: l2
Program variables: x^0
   3: l2 -> l1 : x^0'=1, T, cost: 1

	Propagated Equalities

	Original rule:
	l2 -> l1 : x^0'=x^post1, (-1+x^post1 == 0 /\ -x^post2+x^0 == 0), cost: 1
	New rule:
	l2 -> l1 : x^0'=1, (0 == 0 /\ -x^post2+x^0 == 0), cost: 1
	
		propagated equality x^post1 = 1
		
	Propagated Equalities

	Original rule:
	l2 -> l1 : x^0'=1, (0 == 0 /\ -x^post2+x^0 == 0), cost: 1
	New rule:
	l2 -> l1 : x^0'=1, 0 == 0, cost: 1
	
		propagated equality x^post2 = x^0
		
	Simplified Guard

	Original rule:
	l2 -> l1 : x^0'=1, 0 == 0, cost: 1
	New rule:
	l2 -> l1 : x^0'=1, T, cost: 1
