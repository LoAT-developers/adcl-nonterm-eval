	Loop Acceleration

	Original rule:
	[3] -> [3] : x'=-1+x, y'=1+y, (-y+x > 0), cost: 1
	New rule:
	[3] -> [3] : x'=-n+x, y'=n+y, (2-2*n-y+x > 0 /\ -1+n >= 0), cost: 1

		-y+x > 0 [0]: montonic decrease yields 2-2*n-y+x > 0
		
		-y+x > 0 [1]: eventual increase yields (2 <= 0 /\ -y+x > 0)
		
		Replacement map: {-y+x > 0 -> 2-2*n-y+x > 0}
