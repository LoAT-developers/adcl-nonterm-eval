Start location: [1]

   9: [3] -> [3] : y'=n+y, (-1+n >= 0 /\ 1-n-y+x > 0), cost: 1

	Loop Acceleration

	Original rule:
	[3] -> [3] : y'=1+y, (-y+x > 0), cost: 1
	New rule:
	[3] -> [3] : y'=n+y, (-1+n >= 0 /\ 1-n-y+x > 0), cost: 1

		-y+x > 0 [0]: montonic decrease yields 1-n-y+x > 0
		
		-y+x > 0 [1]: eventual increase yields (1 <= 0 /\ -y+x > 0)
		
		Replacement map: {-y+x > 0 -> 1-n-y+x > 0}
