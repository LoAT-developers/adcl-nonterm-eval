Initial ITS

Start location: l3
Program variables:
   0: l0 -> l1 : 1 <= 0, cost: 1
   1: l1 -> l0 : 0 <= 0, cost: 1
   2: l2 -> l0 : 0 <= 0, cost: 1
   3: l3 -> l2 : 0 <= 0, cost: 1

Chained Linear Paths

Start location: l3
Program variables:
   4: l3 -> l0 : 0 <= 0, cost: 1

	Eliminating location l2 by chaining:

	Applied chaining

	First rule:
	l3 -> l2 : 0 <= 0, cost: 1
	Second rule:
	l2 -> l0 : 0 <= 0, cost: 1
	New rule:
	l3 -> l0 : 0 <= 0, cost: 1
	
	Applied deletion

	Removed the following rules: 2 3
	
	Eliminating location l1 by chaining:

	Applied deletion

	Removed the following rules: 0 1

Simplified Transitions

Start location: l3
Program variables:
   5: l3 -> l0 : T, cost: 1

	Simplified Guard

	Original rule:
	l3 -> l0 : 0 <= 0, cost: 1
	New rule:
	l3 -> l0 : T, cost: 1
