Start location: [1]

   6: [1] -> [3] : i'=-1+nondet, n'=nondet, T, cost: 1

   8: [3] -> [3] : i'=-1+i, -1+i > 0, cost: 1
   9: [3] -> [3] : i'=-n4+i, (-n4+i > 0 /\ -1+n4 >= 0), cost: 1

	Loop Acceleration

	Original rule:
	[3] -> [3] : i'=-1+i, (-1+i > 0), cost: 1
	New rule:
	[3] -> [3] : i'=-n4+i, (-n4+i > 0 /\ -1+n4 >= 0), cost: 1

		-1+i > 0 [0]: montonic decrease yields -n4+i > 0
		
		-1+i > 0 [1]: eventual increase yields (1 <= 0 /\ -1+i > 0)
		
		Replacement map: {-1+i > 0 -> -n4+i > 0}
