Chained Linear Paths

Start location: __init
Program variables:
   0: f31_0_main_Load -> f31_0_main_Load : T, cost: 1
   3: __init -> f31_0_main_Load : T, cost: 1

	Eliminating location f1_0_main_ConstantStackPush by chaining:

	Applied chaining

	First rule:
	__init -> f1_0_main_ConstantStackPush : T, cost: 1
	Second rule:
	f1_0_main_ConstantStackPush -> f31_0_main_Load : T, cost: 1
	New rule:
	__init -> f31_0_main_Load : T, cost: 1
	
	Applied deletion

	Removed the following rules: 1 2

	Certificate of Non-Termination

	Original rule:
